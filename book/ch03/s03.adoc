== EXERCISE: Remotely Installing a Package on a Client

One of the simplest yet powerful ways that {lm} manages the clients is managing the packages installed on the client. This exercise guides you to install the `tree` package on the registered `leap-client` client.

.Prerequisites
* An Uyuni instance with a registered client.
* A synchronized repository.
* A channel assigned to the registered client that links to the content of the synchronized repository.

To install the `tree` package, execute the following steps:

. On the `leap-client` client, verify that the `tree` command is not available:
+
[source,none]
----
leap-client:~ # tree
If 'tree' is not a typo you can use command-not-found to lookup the package that contains it, like this:
    cnf tree
----

. In the Uyuni web UI, click *Systems*, *System List*, then *leap-client.tf.local*.
+
In the client information pane, click *Software*, then *Install*.

. In the filter box, type *tree-1*, and click the filter button.
+
.Software Selection List

. Check the check box next to the `tree` package. In this case, it is the `tree-1.7.0-1.30` package.
+
Click *Install Packages*, then click *Confirm*.

. Uyuni schedules a new Salt event, which installs the selected package. Click the *scheduled* link in the `1 package install has been scheduled for leap-client.tf.local` confirmation message.

. In the *Events* page for the client, you see a new *Package Install/Upgrade scheduled by admin* event.

. Refresh the page until the event disappears from the *Pending* events. Then, click *History* to see the event successfully finished.
