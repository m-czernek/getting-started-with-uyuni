== EXERCISE: Assigning Channels to a Registered Client

.Prerequisites
This exercise assumes that you have access to a deployed Uyuni instance with a registered client, and at least one channel.

In the previous exercise, you created channels by using CLM project. However, the channels are not assigned to any client.

To assign the `opensuse-leap-15-6-base-qa-openSUSE Leap 15.6 (x86_64)` channel to the registered client, execute the following steps:

. In the Uyuni web UI, click *Systems*. Then, click *leap-client.tf.local*.

. Click *Software*, then *Software Channels*.

. Select `opensuse-leap-15-6-base-qa-openSUSE Leap 15.6 (x86_64)` in the *Custom Channels* selection. Click *Next*, then click *Confirm*.

. Uyuni schedules a new event to change the assigned channel. Click *Events*, then click *History*. Refresh the page until you see the `Subscribe channels scheduled by admin` event.

. Click *Details* and verify that the subscribed channel is now *opensuse-leap-15-6-base-qa-openSUSE Leap 15.6 (x86_64)*.
